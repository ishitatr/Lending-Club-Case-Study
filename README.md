# Lending Club Case Study
> A loan lending company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.Using consumer attributes and loan attributes , parameters which might be responsible for loan default are found out. This is done based on previously available data in .csv format.

## General Information
- The project tries to perform EDA to predict which people might default on the loan , so that the loan company can reduce their financial loss.
- It is a Exploratory Data Analysis project for loan lending club case study.
- To identify driver variables which might help the lending club in predicting who might default.
- A .csv file was provided with all the relavant information.

## Conclusions
- The grade of the loan has a significant impact on the probability of default.
- The interet rate of the loan is positively correlated to default probability.
- The debt to income ratio (DTI) is positively correlated to default probability.
- Higher number of derogatory public records leads to higher probability of default as well.
- Loans for business purposes have a high probability of default.
